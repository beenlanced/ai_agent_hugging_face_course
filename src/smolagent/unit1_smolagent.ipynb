    "# Project 1: Making an AI Agent Using Smolagents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Follow the instructions \n",
    "Here are [instructions](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/tutorial) for the tutorial that are helpful for this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "This project uses `smolagents`, a library that provides a framework for developing your agents with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lightweight library is designed for simplicity, but it abstracts away much of the complexity of building an Agent, allowing you to focus on designing your agent’s behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "`smolagents` is a library that focuses on `codeAgent`, a kind of agent that performs “Actions” through code blocks, and then “Observes” results by executing the code.\n",

    "### Serverless API usage\n",
    "[source](https://brisktechsol.com/serverless-apis/)\n",
    "\n",
    "A serverless API is an API built on a serverless architecture, where developers don’t have to manage servers or the underlying infrastructure. Instead, cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud take care of provisioning resources, scaling infrastructure automatically based on demand, and handling server maintenance tasks such as updates, patches, and monitoring. This hands-off approach allows developers to focus entirely on writing business logic and implementing functionality, rather than worrying about operational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Serverless APIs typically rely on event-driven functions that execute code only when specific events or triggers occur, such as a user submitting a request or an update being made to a database. This model makes serverless APIs highly cost-efficient because resources are only used when necessary, and developers pay only for the compute time they consume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Serverless APIs operate on cloud-based infrastructures where the backend components are managed by cloud providers. This allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about server management, scaling, or maintenance. Here are the core components that power serverless APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cloud Functions:\n",
    "Cloud functions are lightweight, event-driven, stateless functions that execute automatically in response to specific triggers (such as an HTTP request or database event). They are the building blocks of serverless APIs, allowing developers to write small, focused pieces of code for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example platforms include **AWS Lambda**, **Google Cloud Functions**, and **Azure Functions**, each offering seamless scalability and integration with other cloud services.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These functions only run when needed, which helps reduce costs since you’re only billed for the compute time used during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API Gateways:\n",
    "The API gateway serves as the interface between the client (e.g., a mobile app, web app, or IoT device) and the backend serverless functions. It acts as a traffic manager, routing incoming API requests to the correct cloud function while handling authentication, rate limiting, and other security measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Common tools include **AWS API Gateway**, **Google Cloud Endpoints**, and **Azure API Management**.\n",
    "API gateways also enable version control and provide detailed analytics, helping developers monitor usage and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, serverless APIs are especially well-suited for modern applications, such as mobile apps, IoT devices, and microservices, where flexibility, scalability, and cost-control are key priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Event Sources and Triggers:\n",
    "Serverless APIs depend on various event sources or triggers to execute functions. These triggers could include HTTP requests, database updates, file uploads to cloud storage, scheduled jobs (e.g., cron jobs), or even external events like a message in a queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Events are the lifeblood of serverless architecture, enabling automation and seamless interaction between different cloud services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database Integration:\n",
    "Serverless APIs often work with managed database solutions to handle data storage and retrieval. These databases are highly scalable, designed to handle the dynamic workloads typical of serverless applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Examples include **AWS DynamoDB**, **Google Firestore**, and **Firebase Realtime Database**.\n",
    "They integrate smoothly with cloud functions, ensuring minimal latency and optimized performance, even during traffic spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow of a Serverless API\n",
    "\n",
    "* Client Request: The process begins when a client, such as a mobile app, web application, or IoT device, sends a request to the serverless API via the API gateway. This request could be for retrieving data, performing an action, or submitting information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* API Gateway Routing: The API gateway serves as the entry point for all incoming requests. It verifies the request, applies any necessary security measures (like validating API keys or tokens), and then routes the request to the appropriate serverless function based on the predefined route or endpoint configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function Execution: When the serverless function is triggered, it executes the required business logic to fulfill the client’s request. This could include tasks like performing calculations, processing submitted data, fetching or updating information in a database, or calling external APIs or services. The function is designed to operate independently and is only active when requested, making it highly efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Response Generation: After completing its task, the serverless function prepares a response. This response contains the result of the processed request, which could include data, a success message, or error details.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Response Delivery: The API gateway receives the response from the serverless function and forwards it back to the client. The client can then display or use this response as needed.\n",
