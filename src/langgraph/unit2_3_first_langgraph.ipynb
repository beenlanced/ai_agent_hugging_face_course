    "### Description:\n",
    "This project uses `langgraph`, a library that provides a framework for developing your agents with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at Agents here. \n",

    "### The Problem this Notebook Attempts to Solve\n",
    "\n",
    "Alfred’s email processing system, where he needs to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read incoming emails\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classify them as spam or legitimate\n",
    "\n",
    "* Draft a preliminary response for legitimate emails\n",
    "\n",
    "* Send information to Mr. Wayne when legitimate (printing only)\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to structure a workflow with LangGraph that involves LLM-based decision-making. While this can’t be considered an Agent as no tool is involved, this section focuses more on learning the LangGraph framework than Agents.\n",
